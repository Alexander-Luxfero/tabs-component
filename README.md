# 📝 Tabbed Content Component on React

This **React-based tabbed content component** is designed for switching between multiple tabs and dynamically displaying content. It offers a simple yet flexible foundation that can be expanded for various use cases, such as educational materials or projects requiring intuitive content navigation.

## ✨ **Component Overview**:

### 1. **Tabbed Component**:

- **Props**: Accepts an array of `content` objects as props and dynamically generates tabs based on the array length.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` to track the active tab and switch between the content displayed in each tab.
- **Key Feature**: If the user clicks beyond the last tab, a default **"last page"** message is shown, indicating the end of the content.

### 2. **Tab Component**:

- Renders individual tabs for each piece of content.
- **Props**: Accepts `num` (tab index), `activeTab` (the currently active tab), and `setActiveTab` (function to switch tabs).

### 3. **TabContent Component**:

- Displays the main content of the selected tab, including a **"show/hide details"** button and a **"like" counter** for interaction.
- Includes features such as **undo actions** and timed state updates using `setTimeout`, offering a smooth user experience.

## 🎯 **Key Features**:

- **Dynamic Tab Creation**: Automatically renders tabs based on the length of the `content` array.
- **Interactive Tab Content**: Each tab maintains its own local state for actions such as toggling details and managing the "like" counter.
- **State Reset on Tab Change**: Each tab resets its local state when switched, showing React's component isolation and state management in action.
- **Undo and Timed Actions**: Includes buttons for immediate and delayed undo actions, enhancing interactivity.

## 💻 **Example Use Case**:

```jsx
const content = [
  { likes: 10, summary: "Tab 1", details: "Details for Tab 1" },
  { likes: 5, summary: "Tab 2", details: "Details for Tab 2" },
];

<Tabbed content={content} />;
```

This component is ideal for beginner developers looking to learn state management, props passing, and reusability in React. It’s also well-suited for projects that require basic content navigation with interactive elements.

🚀 Improvements & Use Cases:

    •	Styling: Applying custom CSS or using a framework like Material UI can greatly enhance the UI.
